This is an example for `emulating' the (binned) linear power spectrum. 

The script `create_training_dataset.py` creates a training and a test data set on which to train and evaluate the neural network.
The script `train_nn.py` trains the emulator and saves the neural network model.

All the action for the neural network training happens in the script 'emulator/nn_emulator.py'.
